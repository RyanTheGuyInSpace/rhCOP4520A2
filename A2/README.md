This implementation relies on the number of cupcakes eaten to notify the minotaur of
everyone who has entered. Each guest will always eat the cupcake. Therefore, the minotaur
should know that everyone has made it to the end since each cupcake will have been eaten.
If the number of cupcakes eaten is greater than or equal to the number of guests, then
it is confirmed that every guest has gone through the labyrinth. 

I like this implementation because the guests don't really need to coordinate anything
besides taking the cupcake each time they enter the labyrinth.
